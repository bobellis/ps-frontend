        <div id="about-me" class="intro">
            <p>Working as an IT Consultant for eight years, I helped my clients by managing their infrastructures, solving problems and offering guidance when making technology decisions. Occasionally, I also got the opportunity to build new applications
                and websites. I really loved that aspect of my job and in 2015 I decided to take my career in that direction full time.</p>
            <p>Since then I've completed a Ruby on Rails bootcamp with Epicodus which was a lot of fun. As part of the Epicodus program I worked as an intern for Multnomah County where a fellow student and I build several Node.js servers as well as an iOS
                and Android app that monitors the draw bridges in Portland and notifies users if the bridges are up or down. It was really exciting to work on something that was so iconic in Portland, like the bridges, we even got to ride the Hawthorne
                counterweight!
            </p>
            <p>After working for the County, I really wanted to get some more front end experience, so I applied for another internship with Modus Operandi and was accepted. ModuOp is a nationwide advertising company that specializes in building single page
                applications and has built these experiences for many well known companies. At Modop, I've had the chance to work on a marketing site for Ubisoft's "The Division" game.</p>
