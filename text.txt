After working as an IT consultant for 8 years, I decided to turn my interest in software into a career and get into web development. I completed a Ruby on Rails boot camp, followed by an internship building node servers and a restful API and am now wrapping up another internship focused on front end frameworks and single page applications. These internship have allowed me to see a wide range of web technologies and I'm excited about working for a company where I can continue learning and growing as a developer.

Working as an IT Consultant for eight years, I helped my clients by managing their infrastructures, solving problems and offering guidance when making technology decisions. Occasionally, I also got the opportunity to build new applications and websites. I really loved that aspect of my job and in 2015 I decided to take my career in that direction full time. 
Since then I've completed a Ruby on Rails bootcamp with Epicodus which was a lot of fun. As part of the Epicodus program I worked as an intern for Multnomah County where a fellow student and I build several Node.js servers as well as an iOS and Android app that monitors the draw bridges in Portland and notifies users if the bridges are up or down. It was really exciting to work on something that was so iconic in Portland, like the bridges, we even got to ride the Hawthorne counterweight!
After working for the County, I decided to get some more front end experience and took an internship with Modus Operandi. Modop specializes in building single page applications and has built these experiences for many well known companies. At Modop, I've had the chance to work on a marketing site for Ubisoft's "The Division" game.
